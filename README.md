# Donkey Kong Arcade - On The Run

This is the Donkey Kong - On The Run rom-hack for the arcade version of Donkey Kong.

Not only did Donkey Kong kidnap Pauline again ...
... this time he also sabotaged the stages !!!

Stolen ladders? Malfunctioning hammers, pies and springs?

It is clear that he is ON THE RUN now ...

On most emulators (e.g. WolfMame) you can play this game by replacing the original dkong.zip by this On The Run version of the dkong.zip. You have to start the emulator without checksum checking (in WolfMame by starting it from the command line and specifying the romname).
